api testing is:
api recon
paramater acceptance and supported content type of api
http method acceptance
rate limit and authentications


api recon:
chcek the root link
investigate js files for endpoints

for machine readalble docs Postman or SoapUI


You can use the built-in HTTP verbs list in Burp Intruder to automatically cycle through a range of methods

mass assignment??

PHP parses the last parameter only. This would result in a user search for carlos.
ASP.NET combines both parameters. This would result in a user search for peter,carlos, which might result in an Invalid username error message.
Node.js / express parses the first parameter only. This would result in a user search for peter, giving an unchanged result.


practice:
change get requests to Patch
always check the /api path

api docs are in these paths:
/api
/swagger/index.html
/openapi.json
