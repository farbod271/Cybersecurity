# Impact and Security Considerations

This section outlines how authentication flaws can expose more attack surfaces and the impact of specific vulnerabilities.

## Key Points

- **Authentication and Attack Surface**: If authentication can be bypassed, it opens up more of the attack surface for exploration. For example, in RedBull, bypassing authentication allows you to access the attack surface behind the login page.

- **Brute Force Attacks**: You can use smarter brute force techniques and factor in human errors. For example, small typing errors may occur, where just one character out of place makes two messages distinct, even if the character is not visible on the rendered page.

- **Response Time and User Enumeration**: Response time can be used for user enumeration. Even slight delays in response times can indicate valid usernames or other information.

- **Bypassing Defenses**: Including your own login credentials at regular intervals within a wordlist can render certain defenses, like rate limiting, ineffective.

- **HTTP Basic Authentication**: The format for Basic Authentication is:  
  `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`

- **IP-Based Blocking**: For IP-based blocking, you can manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header to bypass restrictions.
