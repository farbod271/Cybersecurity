just omit the thing that is being checked and maybe it works? omit key and value completely

The two-minute window does not apply to cookies that were explicitly set with the SameSite=Lax attribute.

eTLD is when you have two top level domains like co.uk wven tho its a subdomain actually

same origin also adds port and sub to same site

so open resirects are great for csrf
and you have to look for the js file that is handling it. its not induced in burp

sometimes if you omit the referer header altogether you can bypass csrf
